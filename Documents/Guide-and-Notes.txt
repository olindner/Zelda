The Chomper mechanic is slightly buggy, in that sometimes in order to make it push blocks effectively, you may have to rotate (using S) it a few times.
Also, the pushable blocks may be a bit buggy and require a room reset (walk out of current room, and back in again).
The mechanic DOES work with a couple trials.

Guide to Custom Level:

Extra Cheat Code: F5 teleports to Custom Level boss room. Boss will not instantiate at first, so you must leave the room (down) and reenter to instantiate the boss.

(Custom Level is sequential, so "First", "Second", etc refers to the rooms beginning with the room you spawn in ("First")
First Room) ---
Second Room) Kill all Stalfos to spawn Chomper Pickup (enables Chomper when acquired)
Third Room) Kill all Gel and push out of place block in (to the right) to make solid 6 block to open door
Fourth Room) Kill all Keese and push single block on island to the right
Fifth Room) Kill all enemies
Sixth Room) Kill all enemies
Seventh Room) Push block inside corner partition up one space (end result of blocks looks kind of like Hangman) to change tiles in front of door to floor tiles
Eighth Room) Kill all Stalfos and push both blocks on both small islands one space to the right to unlock door
Ninth Room) Kill all enemies and push blocks on either side of the  rivers one space up
Tenth Room) Kill all Kese and push all four blocks:
	-first/third blocks from the right: push one up
- 	-second/fourth blocks from the right: push one down
Eleventh Room) Spiketraps can't be killed, so wall them off by pushing all 6 blocks not immediately next to a Spiketrap in front of the closest Spiketrap (on the righthand side, where
the 4 spiketraps are right next to each other, all blocks are pushed to the right one; on the left hand side, the blocks are pushed to the left)
Twelfth Room) Push the one red block all the way to the red square
Thirteenth Room) Kill all enemies
Fourteenth Room) Kill all enemies for key pickup to BOSS BATTLE
Boss battle) Can't kill boss; must push the appropriately colored block to the code-matched colored tiles so that the boss can't extend arms anymore.
